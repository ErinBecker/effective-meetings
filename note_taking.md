At the end of this episode, participants will be able to...

- Succinctly capture decisions, action items, owners, and deadlines in meeting notes.

So you've been designated the Notetaker for a meeting - what does that mean? 
Do you need to try to type every word that is spoken?
How do you make sure you're capturing the right information? 
To answer this question, it's useful to first focus on what the goal(s) are for having a Notetaker, which are (at least) two-fold: 

- Make a record of decisions that were made, and any significant dissent that was raised.
- Keep track of any follow-up action items (including who is responsible for them and what the deadlines are!). 

Depending on the formality of the meeting (e.g. a Board meeting), you may also have an obligation to provide an official record of the meeting, who attended, and what was discussed and decided.


## Why Your Notetaker Should be a Human

You may be wondering why you should bother to take notes at all.
After all, most, if not all, video conferencing systems now enable automated note taking with AI tools.
The makers of these tools claim they can capture conversations, record action items, and circulate meeting notes to participants, without you having to do any of the work!
Although these tools are becoming more popular, we strongly advise against relying on them, and urge careful consideration before deciding to use them in your meetings at all.
There are a number of reasons to instead trust your note taking duties to a human, including security and privacy, quality, and usefulness of the resulting notes. 

### Security and Privacy

- AI notetakers expose your meeting data to the company that owns the tool (problems for confidentiality)
- Some of these issues are issues of *accuracy* but others are issues of *usefulness*. If your AI tool is going to capture everything said during the meeting, a human still needs to go through those notes and correct them or actionabilize them.
- AI notetakers might also hallucinate things . . . 


### Quality

Because all AI tools are dependent on their training data, AI note takers often perform more poorly when speakers have accents different from the majority language community used for training.
In effect, this means that meeting participants who are not native speakers of  

- Better with regional variations in speech / accents
- Humans know the technical terms / jargon your group is using (or if they don't they might ask a question instead of guessing!)

### Usefulness

- Better at filtering important information
- Able to capture decision points
- Can proactively clarify points of confusion for the record


## Other

- Requires critical engagement with the meeting!

## AI Notetakers and Accessibility

Although we do not recommend relying on AI tools for record keeping, that doesn't mean AI notetakers are useless!
AI notetakers can be useful tools, particularly for Deaf or Hard of Hearing individuals, and for people for whom the meeting language is not their primary language.
We recommend allowing AI notetakers on a case-by-case basis if requested by a meeting participant for accessibility reasons.
