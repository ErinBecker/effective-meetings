## Our First Exercise (10 minutes)

Think of an example of a bad meeting you attended.
What did you find was making you not want to attend more meetings like it? 
Why did it make such an impression on you?
Try to differentiate between **what was bad about the behavior** of the chair and attendees
and **what was good about the setup** of the meeting.
Take a few minutes to write down some notes about your answer,
then introduce yourself to the other participants and tell them about it.
