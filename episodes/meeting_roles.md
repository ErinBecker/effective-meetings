After completing this episode, participants will be able to…

* Define three essential meeting roles and their functions.
* Prepare meeting participants to fulfill these roles. 
* Assign roles to participants fairly.

Now that you've done the important work of deciding what your meeting is about, what  you want to discuss and decide, and for how long, it's time to make sure the meeting itself runs smoothly. 
In order to do this, you will need individuals to take on a few specific roles - Facilitator, Notetaker, and Timekeeper.

## Assigning Roles

It is important to make sure roles are assigned fairly. 
Ideally, roles should rotate across all meeting participants. 
This helps to establish meeting norms and gives participants a shared responsibility for upholding them. 
However, do provide an option for people to opt out of roles, either for an individual meeting (they may be trying to eat lunch or managing care-giving duties), or for all meetings (someone who uses voice-typing may not be able to be Notetaker).

Don't rely on volunteers, as junior people in the meeting may feel implicit pressure to take the roles that are perceived to have less power (like Notetaker) and be less likely to take on more powerful roles (like Facilitator).
We recommend using a randomiser to assign meeting roles - for example [random.org/lists](https://www.random.org/lists/). 


Include meeting role assignments in the agenda when you send it to participants at least a day before the meeting.
For one-time meetings, or meetings where the participant list varies over time, it can be helpful to include a short description of each role at the top of the agenda. For example: 

```markdown

## Meeting Roles 
- Facilitator - Amina
- Notetaker - Mateo
- Timekeeper - Sofia
- Backup - Kwame

## Role Description
- Facilitator: Introduces agenda items, monitors for raised hands, keeps track of order, and ensures everyone has an opportunity to share their views.
- Notetaker: Records meeting attendance and major points of discussion, with a particular emphasis on decisions and action items.
- Timekeeper: Pays attention to the clock and alerts the group when time for specific agenda items is running low.
- Backup: Fills in for any of these roles if the designated person needs to be away from keyboard.


```

Although introducing and socialising meeting roles may take a few minutes of precious meeting time, it will be well worth it for the gains in meeting focus, shared ownership, and engagement.
Once you start using meeting roles, you'll wonder how you ever lived through meetings without them! 
Now let's explore each role in more detail.


## The Facilitator

The Facilitator is responsible for keeping people on the agenda and avoiding tangents. 
In some contexts, the Facilitator may be referred to as the meeting Chair.
However, it is important to note that, like the other meeting roles, the Facilitator role should rotate across participants and should not be restricted to the person who prepared the agenda.

The Facilitator will introduce each agenda item, and pass leadership of that item over to the item owner (usually the person who submitted the agenda request). 
During discussion of that item, the Facilitator will monitor the meeting chat and visual meeting window to keep track of who is waiting to speak and to raise attention to any questions that have been asked in the chat.
Participants can signal that they want a turn to speak by using your video-conferencing platform's "raise hand" feature, typing "hand" in the chat, or physically raising their hand. 
The Facilitator can recognise the turn order either verbally or by typing in the chat ("e.g. Amina next, then Lucas, then Mei.")

The Facilitator should take an active role in prompting individuals who haven't contributed to share their thoughts. 
In larger group meetings, this can be achieved through a general prompt (e.g. "I'd like to hear from some of the folks in the room who haven't shared yet."). 
In smaller groups, especially those with recurring attendees, it may be more appropriate to ask individuals by name (e.g. "Hiro, I noticed you've been quiet today - did you have thoughts you'd like to add?").

It will also be the Facilitator's job to moderate disruptive behaviours that may occur during the meeting, such as an individual dominating the conversation or interrupting other participants.
We will learn specific strategies for dealing with disruptive behaviours later in this lesson.

## The Timekeeper

The Timekeeper's role is to monitor the clock and alert the Facilitator when time is running short for an item. 
They will adjust the agenda timestamps as needed based on input from the Facilitator and other participants. 
For example, the owner of a later agenda item may decide to donate time to the current item if the discussion is being productive, or may ask the Facilitator to move their item to the garage for a future meeting.

The Timekeeper's role is informational, not decisive. 
Once the Timekeeper has notified the Facilitator about the timing status, it is the Facilitator's decision whether to reallocate time or move to the next item.
This is one reason why the Facilitator's role is so powerful, and why it should rotate across participants. 

## The Notetaker

The Notetaker's job is to make a written record of the major points of discussion.
Notes should not be a transcript of the meeting, but rather should focus on ideas considered, decisions made, and action items to be followed up on. 
Although a Notetaker should be assigned for each meeting, all meeting participants should be empowered to correct, add to, or otherwise amend the notes in real time. 
Group participation in note-taking is helpful for the Notetaker (for example if they've missed a point made), and also helps alleviate any (hopefully unintentional!) bias in whose opinions are placed on the record.

As much as possible, the Notetaker should record not just the idea shared, but also who shared it (using initials or full names if appropriate). 
This allows for proper crediting of ideas, and also enables follow-up after the meeting if additional clarity or detail is needed.

More guidelines on how to take good notes will be covered later in this lesson.

## The Backup

The Backup does not play a specific role during the meeting, but rather is prepared to step into any role as needed, either temporarily or for the remainder of the meeting.
For example, if the Notetaker has to leave their desk to deal with an urgent phone call, or if the Facilitator's internet connection drops.
Having a backup in place will help protect your meeting against the uncertainties of the digital workplace, and will also have the secondary effect of increasing participant attention!

## Diagnosing and Preventing Role Breakdowns (15 minutes)

It can be scary to hand over control of a meeting to the other participants, especially after you've put in so much work to coordinating schedules and designing an amazing agenda!
How can you help ensure meeting roles are carried out successfully, and what signs can you watch for that might indicate problems?
