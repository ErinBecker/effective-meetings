If you're going to have a meeting, you should have something to meet about. Meetings shouldn't happen
just because they're recurring on the calendar. Whether for recurring meetings or one-off meetings, 
the meeting host should take some time in advance to decide what topics will be discussed, for how long, and what the intended outcomes are. 

Have a process for attendees to propose agenda items. The Carpentries uses a Google form for this. Two days before the meeting, attendees must indicate their proposed topic and the amount of time they want, along with any preparatory materials (e.g. pre-reading) people should do before the meeting. They should also indicate whether the agenda item is time sensitive. The meeting host triages submitted topics to create the agenda, selecting the most important, time-sensitive, and/or impactful items for discussion. 

Include time estimates - both as number of minutes and associated time stamps. This keeps early agenda items from dominating the meeting time and ensures all topics get their fair share of the group's attention. Keeping the meeting to time will be the job of the timekeeper (discussed later). If an agenda item is taking longer than expected, the item owner can request additional time, awarded based on consent of the remaining agenda item owners. 

For online meetings spanning multiple time zones, time stamps should be listed in a time zone agnostic format (i.e. a 15 minute agenda item starting at the top of the hour can be listed as :00 - :15). Time stamps should be adjusted by the timekeeper as meeting time is requested and ceeded.

The meeting host should send the meeting agenda to all participants at least 24-hours before the meeting along with any required pre-reading.
