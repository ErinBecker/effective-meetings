Now that you've done the important work of deciding what your meeting is about, what 
you want to discuss and decide, and for how long, now its time to make sure the 
meeting itself runs smoothly. In order to do this, you will need individuals to take
on a couple of specific roles - a Facilitator, a Timekeeper, and a Notetaker. 

## The Facilitator

The Facilitator is responsible for keeping people on the agenda and avoiding tangents. After introducing an agenda item, the Facilitator will monitor the meeting chat and visual meeting to keep track of who is waiting to speak. Participants can 
show that they want a turn to speak by using your video-conferencing platform's "raise hand" feature, typing "hand" in the chat, or physically raising their hand. The Facilitator can recognise the turn order either verbally or in the chat ("e.g. Amina next, then Lucas, then Mei.")  

## The Timekeeper


## The Notetaker


## Assigning Roles

Make sure roles are assigned fairly. Don't rely on volunteers, as the junior people in the meeting will feel implicit pressure to take the roles that are perceived to have less power (like notetaker) and will be less likely to take on more powerful roles (like facilitator). Do provide an option for people to opt out of roles, either for an individual meeting (they may be trying to eat lunch or managing care-giving duties), or for all meetings (someone who uses voice-typing may not be able to be notetaker).
